# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

Credit Dataset Analysis

This project demonstrates various machine learning techniques applied to the UCI Default of Credit Card Clients dataset. It includes data preprocessing, training of different classifiers, and comparison of their performance metrics. The analysis explores Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Random Forest ensemble methods (Bagging and Boosting).

Project Structure

Dataset Fetching: Automatically downloads and extracts the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, renames columns, and converts numeric features to the appropriate data type.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Checks for class imbalance and visualizes the dataset.

Model Training and Evaluation: Includes implementations of Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest (Bagging and Boosting).

Performance Metrics Comparison: Compares models based on Accuracy, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
